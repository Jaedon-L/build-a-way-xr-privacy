  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 19, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Build a Way XR</strong> (the “App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information when you use the App. Our short, clear promise: we do not collect or transmit personal data from players. Any saved progress and settings are stored locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>Who we are</h2>
  <p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Jaedon Lee</p>
  <p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:jaedonlee@gmail.com">jaedonlee@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>This policy applies only to data collected by the App itself and the services the App directly provides. It does not apply to third-party websites or services linked from the App.</p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not collect personal data.</strong> Build a Way XR does not request, collect, or transmit names, email addresses, device identifiers tied to a person, or other personally identifiable information to any server or third party.</p>

  <h3>Local data stored on your device</h3>
  <p>We store the following types of data locally on your device to support gameplay and user experience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Saved progress (completed levels, unlocked content, player settings)</li>
    <li>Local configuration (in-game settings, preferences)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This local data remains on your device and is not uploaded to our servers or shared with third parties.</p>

  <h2>On-device features and third-party components</h2>
  <p>The App may include third-party libraries or SDKs to support runtime functionality (for example physics or VR frameworks). These components are integrated in a way that does not send personal user data off the device. If we include any third-party model files or assets, they are packaged with the App and run locally.</p>

  <h2>No analytics, advertising, or tracking</h2>
  <p>We do not use in-App analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking services that collect personal data. If this changes in the future (for example to support anonymous usage analytics), we will update this policy and provide a clear notice.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The App is offered to users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us and we will take steps to remove that information.</p>

  <h2>Data retention & deletion</h2>
  <p>All game progress and settings stored by the App live locally on your device. To remove this data you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use any in-App options to clear saved data (if provided).</li>
    <li>Uninstall the App from your device, which removes local storage used by the App.</li>
    <li>Contact us at <a href="mailto:jaedonlee@gmail.com">jaedonlee@gmail.com</a> for assistance with data removal requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect local data stored by the App. However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. Users are responsible for device-level security (lock screens, OS updates, etc.).</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. If we make material changes we will update the “Last updated” date and, where reasonable, provide a notice within the App or on the store page. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>Contact us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or requests about this policy or data stored by the App, contact:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email: <a href="mailto:jaedonlee@gmail.com">jaedonlee@gmail.com</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Thank you for using Build a Way XR. We respect your privacy and are committed to keeping your gameplay local and private.</em></p>
